To run the program there are a few steps

First you run the program in two diffrent modes, first you can use the pre inputed puzzles from the testpuzzles.txt file.

The other mode is to allow the user to input a puzzle of their own. 

To run the program with the pre inputed puzzles just run "python UI.py"

This will show you the system running 3 diffrent puzzles and the logs for each.

To use the other mode you need to use the PuzzleFormatter.py, in it you can see a grid 9x9 input the puzzle in it, use 0 where there is empty cells in your puzzle.

Run the file using "python PuzzleFormater.py"

Copy the output this is the string that you will input to the system.

Then in the terminal run "python UI.py copiedString"

example "python UI.py 010000005260437000004000006000050709000743002040001050000006093900000807630179000"
